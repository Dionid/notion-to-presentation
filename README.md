# Notion to Presentation

1. Get data from Notion Web API
1. Convert to HTML in a format that can be used in reveal.js

# Stack

1. Go
1. Pocketbase
1. Templ
1. HTMX
1. Vue

# Word of caution

This project is NOT about best practices. It's about making product
and do it efficiently. I haven't been working with Vue for a long time,
and this is first time for me to use Pocketbase, Templ and HTMX.

Don't take this project as a reference for best practices.
